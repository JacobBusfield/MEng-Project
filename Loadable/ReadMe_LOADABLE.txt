========================================================================

Controllers

This contains a set of .txt files that correspond to different 
controllers that can be loaded by the epiNet readNetwork function.
	

Sim Designs

This contains a set of folders which relate to the different road designs
available in the simulation. In each are the design, test and map files
which can be loaded by the simulation. To understand how each is written
specification .pdfs are provided.

========================================================================
Note there is no readMe file in either child folder, as their naming is
fairly self-evident. And source/_Top Level/files.h which is used to call
these files, has a good description if required.
