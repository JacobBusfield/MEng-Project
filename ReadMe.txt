========================================================================

Welcome.

This is the top level for the software files for the project entitled:
 "Developing Epigenetic Networks to Optimise Trac Control Systems."

This Read Me will explain the struture of this folder level. Later Read
Mes will break down subsequent folders. Specifically the Source,
Loadable and Matlab Folders.



========================================================================
		             FOLDERS
========================================================================

Source   - Contains all C++ source code for the project.

Loadable - Contains files that can be loaded by the agent-based
           simulation, such as controller and simulation designs.

Matlab   - Contains all the Matlab files. This includes data and graphs.

Include  - Contains the SFML library.

Images   - Contains a single car image required by the agent-based
           simulation.


lib, ipch, Debug - Standard folders required by Visual Studio 2015 to
                   Compile the project code.
