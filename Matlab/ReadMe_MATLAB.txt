4-Way Junction Controller

The first set of controllers developed in the project. This folder
contains source files for how the final metholodogy performed. Also
contains graphs showing the results from different testing conducted.
	

3-Way Junction Controller

A 3-Way junction was designed over the course of the project. data 
from this evolution is presented in this folder.


4 X 4-Way Junction Controllers

The 'big' results from this project. There is a summary graph present
to compare methologies. Each also has its own folder so the original 
data can be inspected.
