EXPERIMENT:
4-WAY JUNCTION FROM SCRATCH

LONG TRAINING DATA.
  - USING UNIFORM DISTRIBUTION, CARS FROM EACH LOCATION
    TO EACH OTHER, USING SHORTEST PATH AND CLOCKWISE.

EVOLUTION
  - SINGLE NETWORK
  - 100 GENERATIONS
  - POP SIZE 50
  - 70% CHANCE CROSSOVER FROM BEST OF RANDOM 3
  - 0.05 MUTATION %
  - 7 TESTS PER GENERATION, 14 ON FINAL SELECTION OF POP
  - BEST TESTS CHOSEN BY MEAN
  - MEAN(INDIVIDUALS) > 2 x MEAN(CHAMPION) ARE KILLED.
  - POPULATION DATA PRINT CONTINOUSLY
  - CONTROLLER DATA, WITH TESTING, EVERY 20 GENS

EPINET
  - 3 IN / 1 OUT 
  - 0.5 IN RATIO / 0.4 OUT RATIO
  - 50 GENES
  - 3 EPI GENES


MOTIVATION:
FIRST BIG TEST OF THE NEW GA METHODOLOGY, CAN IT CREATE
A SUBSTANTIAL CONTROLLER?
