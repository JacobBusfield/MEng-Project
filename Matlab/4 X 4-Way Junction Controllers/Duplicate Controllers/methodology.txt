EXPERIMENT:
4-WAY JUNCTION * 4 (W/ DUPLICATION) FROM SCRATCH

LONG TRAINING DATA.
  - USING UNIFORM DISTRIBUTION, CARS FROM EACH LOCATION
    TO EACH OTHER, USING SHORTEST PATH AND CLOCKWISE.

EVOLUTION
  - DUPLICATE STRATEGY.
  - 500 GNERATIONS
  - POP SIZE 50
  - 70% CHANCE CROSSOVER FROM BEST OF RANDOM 3
  - 0.05 MUTATION %
  - 11 TESTS PER GENERATION, 22 ON FINAL SELECTION OF POP
  - BEST TESTS CHOSEN BY MEAN
  - MEAN(INDIVIDUALS) > 2 x MEAN(CHAMPION) ARE KILLED.
  - TERMINATION AT 500 GENERATIONS
  - POPULATION DATA PRINT CONTINOUSLY
  - CONTROLLER DATA, WITH TESTING, EVERY 20 GENS

EPINET
  - 4 IN / 2 OUT
  - 0.5 IN RATIO / 0.4 OUT RATIO
  - 50 GENES
  - 3 EPI GENES


MOTIVATION:
COEVOLUTION FOR 4WJX4 FROM SCRATCH COULD NOT OUTPERFORM
R-R, EVEN WITHIN >500 GENERATIONS. AND MADE EVOLVED
CONTROLLER, IN ANOTHER TEST WORSE, AS 'GOOD' CHOICES
FROM AVERAGE OF 11 TESTS COULD BE MUCH WORSE ON NEXT 11.
I.E COEVOLUTION WAS INCREDIBLY UNSTABLE. MAYBE TECHNIQUE
OF EVOLVING ONLY ONE AT A TIME IS REQUIRED AS SUPPOSED TO
ALL AT ONCE. ANYHOW, THE ALTERNATIVE METHOD, DUPLICATING
NETWORKS, MUTATING ONE AND DUPLICATING IT AGAIN ARE NOW
BEING TRIALED. THIS FIRST TEST WILL SEE HOW WELL THIS
METHOD WORKS EVOLVING CONTROLLER FROM SCRATCH. (THERE MAY
BE NO NEED TO LATER USE THE 'EVOLVED' ONE).
