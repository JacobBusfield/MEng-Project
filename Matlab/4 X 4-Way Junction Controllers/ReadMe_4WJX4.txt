========================================================================

The 'big' results from this project.

They were conducted on a traffic network of four, four-way controllers
(4WJX4). Design can be found diagramatically in the Project Report.

There is a summary graph present to compare methologies. Each also has
its own folder so the original data can be inspected.

duplicate controllers

Folder contains result files for the duplicate controllers. These
controllers share the same genetic information while being evolved on
the 4WJX4.


imported 4WJ controller

Folder contains result files for the imported 4WJ controller. This
controller was the one presented in simulation\matlab\
4-Way Junction Controller folder. Here it has been duplicated, without
further evoltion into the 4WJX4 (duplicated).


separate controllers

Folder contains result files for the seperate controllers. These
controllers have unique genetic information while being evolved on the
4WJX4.


single master controller

Folder contains result files for the single master controller. This
controller is one large instance that has been evolved to control all
the junctions within the 4WJX4.
