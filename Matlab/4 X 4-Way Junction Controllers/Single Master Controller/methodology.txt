EXPERIMENT:
4-WAY JUNCTION * 4 (W/ HEIRARACHY) FROM SCRATCH

LONG TRAINING DATA.
  - USING UNIFORM DISTRIBUTION, CARS FROM EACH LOCATION
    TO EACH OTHER, USING SHORTEST PATH AND CLOCKWISE.

EVOLUTION
  - SINGLE NETWORK
  - 500 GNERATIONS
  - POP SIZE 50
  - 70% CHANCE CROSSOVER FROM BEST OF RANDOM 3
  - 0.05 MUTATION %
  - 11 TESTS PER GENERATION, 22 ON FINAL SELECTION OF POP
  - BEST TESTS CHOSEN BY MEAN
  - MEAN(INDIVIDUALS) > 2 x MEAN(CHAMPION) ARE KILLED.
  - TERMINATION AT 500 GENERATIONS
  - POPULATION DATA PRINT CONTINOUSLY
  - CONTROLLER DATA, WITH TESTING, EVERY 20 GENS

EPINET
  - 16 IN / 8 OUT (4:2 * 4)
  - 0.5 IN RATIO / 0.4 OUT RATIO
  - 100 GENES
  - 10 EPI GENES


MOTIVATION:
ONE WOULD ASSUME HEIRARACHY HAS TOO MANY IOs FOR EPINET.
BUT TO ASSUME IS TO MAKE AN....
THEREFORE THIS TEST IS TO BE CONDUCTED.
